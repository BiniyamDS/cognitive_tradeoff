# Cognitive Tradeoff Game

This is a Pygame-based cognitive tradeoff game inspired by a concept discussed by **Vsauce** in a YouTube video. The game is based on the **Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis**, which explains the differences in memory capacity between humans and primates, specifically how humans may have lost some short-term memory capacity in exchange for advanced communication and problem-solving abilities. This game simulates a task where players must memorize and sequentially click numbered blocks in order, testing short-term memory and cognitive performance.

## Inspiration

The game draws inspiration from a YouTube video by **Vsauce**, where he explores the **Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis**. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0&pp=ygUdY29nbml0aXZlIHRyYWRlb2ZmIGh5cG90aGVzaXM%3D). In the video, Vsauce explains that while humans have developed sophisticated language and problem-solving skills, this may have come at the cost of certain short-term memory capabilities, which primates like chimpanzees excel at. This game allows players to experience a memory challenge akin to those seen in chimpanzee experiments.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Install the required libraries

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. You will see 10 blocks on the screen with numbers from 1 to 10.

3. Click on the block labeled "1" to begin. The other blocks will then be hidden.

4. Memorize the positions of the hidden blocks and click on them in numerical order (from 2 to 10).

5. If you click the blocks in the correct order, you win! If you click a block out of order, the game ends.

6. Press `R` to restart the game or `Q` to quit.
